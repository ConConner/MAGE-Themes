 # <img src="mage/Resources/Icons/mage.png" width="30"> MAGE Themes
 **Metroid Advance Game Editor Themes**

Metroid Advance Game Editor (MAGE) is a comprehensive hacking utility for Metroid Fusion and Metroid Zero Mission originally created by [biosp4rk](https://github.com/biosp4rk). It is a .NET 3.0 application written in C#.  
MAGE Themes is a modification of the original MAGE 1.4 source code started by [ConConner](https://github.com/ConConner), introducing several bug fixes, quality of life improvements and entirely new features. It is a .NET 6.0 application.

Currently both versions are only compatible with the North American (U) version of each game.

MAGE (the original) is no longer being worked on. Issues should only be directed at MAGE Themes.

## Releases
Releases are created automatically when new features are available on the main branch.  
To launch MAGE Themes you need to install the [.NET Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-9.0.8-windows-x64-installer) version 6 or higher.
