# Metroid Advance Game Editor Themes

Metroid Advance Game Editor (MAGE) is a comprehensive hacking utility for Metroid Fusion and Metroid Zero Mission created by biospark. It is a .NET 3.0 application written in C#.
MAGE Themes is a modification of the original MAGE 1.4 source code created by ConConner. It is a .NET 6.0 application.

Currently both versions are only compatible with the North American (U) version of each game.

The newest updates for both versions can be found in their respective forum threads.
